### üëã Hi, I'm Darshan
I‚Äôm programmer from India, fueled by open-source, and the unkown unkowns. I spend my time in a chronic terminal environment. And when I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me exploring indie hip-hop artists. Also tinkering my glorius ```flake.nix```.

Let‚Äôs chat about Linux magic, RPG min-maxxing or just the current DHH scene.
