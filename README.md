### 👋 Hi, I'm Darshan
I’m programmer from India, fueled by open-source, and the unkown unkowns. I spend my time in a chronic terminal environment. And when I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring indie hip-hop artists. Also tinkering my glorius ```flake.nix```.

Let’s chat about Linux magic, RPG min-maxxing or just the current DHH scene.
